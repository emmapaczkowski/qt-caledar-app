# CMPE 320 - Team Miranda: Scheduling Application 
Team Miranda would like to create a scheduling application with a visual interface to help university students plan their lives and school activities. The objective of the application is to provide a streamlined way of organizing and tracking events, fit for use with the new online learning environment students are facing. The core purpose of the scheduler is to serve as a calendar, allowing students to input their schedule, including classes, study time, social events and more. The scheduler will organize information based on criteria from the user, such as time, date, type of activity etc. and display it in an organized fashion. Within the current scope, the application will be able to interface with SOLUS using the student’s NetID and password to directly input their class schedule. The initial development of the app will be geared towards Queen’s students. Further functionality such as wellness and health tracking could be implemented in the future to diversify the functionality and user base of the app.
